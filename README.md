This is my week 8 quiz, it contains two parts.

## Part 1
I drew inspiration from Madagascar 3's 'Circus Fireworks song' clip. The animators cleverly used spinning circles to mimic fireworks, creating a vibrant and captivating visual. I was interested in Pacita Abad's Wheels of Fortune for my final work. I want to incorporate the spinning circle concept. It adds dynamism, conveying life's flux and vigour. The spinning circle embodies the perpetual motion symbolized by the Wheel of Fortune, depicting life's ceaseless evolution.

#### I provided two images to illustrate my chosen example, you can clear see that the circle's style is rotating.

## Part 2
I want to achieve a circular rotation effect using CSS animation techniques. Different elements exhibit rotation effects by defining `@keyframes` rules, specifying element transformation properties (`transform`), and setting animation duration, iteration count, and timing functions. The animation effect of the `.icon:hover` class triggers upon mouse hover, lasting 4 seconds and looping infinitely. The `.outerCircle` and `.innerCircle` classes display pulsating and circular rotation effects, respectively. This method ensures excellent browser compatibility and allows for customising animation effects and user interactions by adjusting parameters.

#### I provide a screenshot showcasing the coding technique in action.
